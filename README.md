# Football Goal Time Analysis - Predicting Goals per Minute as a Function of Time

The data comprise two CSV files (minutes.csv and results.csv) that contain around three years of football data across European leagues. The task is to use this data to build a model to predict the number of goals scored per minute in football games.

This folder contains a full report of the analysis that was undertaken as well as a markdown file containing my supporting R code.
